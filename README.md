# Forging-Efficient-and-Compact-Image-Generation-Models
This thesis explores compact deep learning models for image generation. It evaluates NST, AEs, VAEs, and GANs, identifying VAEs as strong in context capture but prone to blur. To enhance clarity, VAE-GAN hybrids are proposedâ€”achieving efficient, high-fidelity image synthesis with balanced structure and computational cost.
